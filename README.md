This repo contains all four tasks of the first stage of the MIA training.
The following is a quick overview of all four tasks.
Detailed description of all requirements and submission methods could be found in attatched pdf files.

task 1:
task 1.1:
write a C/C++ program that prints the string ‘GRU’ in the output terminal (console) (Hello World problem). task 1.2: Write a C/C++ program that takes the number to start the countdown from as input and prints the countdown text starting from that number. task 1.3: Create a C/C++ program that allows users to add, view, and remove tasks, each task has an id/index and a description. The id is a positive unique integer. task 1.4: Write a C/C++ program that takes two sensor measurements (just two arrays) and generates only one new array measurement with any averaging method, such as Kalman Filter.

task 2: task 2.1: 1. Design a circuit that takes 220V AC as input and the output is 5V DC and connects LED to the output (Hint: firstly, you need to step down the AC, then you need to convert AC to DC, and lastly connect the load). 2. If the input power budget of your power supply is 1440W, and you use a current limiting resistor with each LED 330 ohm. Estimate how many LEDs could be put in parallel that is suitable for this power budget. task 2.2: Design a simple H-bridge driver to control the direction of the DC motor using transistors. task 2.3: If you have a simple circuit that drive high power 12V LED with current limiting resistor 3.3ohm and need to drive them with 80C liPo (lithium Polymer) batteries that have 5200mAh charge, assume that girls stay inside the box of shame for about 5 hours. How many batteries are connected in parallel to light up the LED for more than 5 hours

task 3: task 3.1: Write 2 Arduino codes, one that interface with two push buttons, and the other one communicates with the first one by receiving data about buttons state, using I2C communication protocol. In the receiving side we need to interface with indicator LED and write a message on the Serial Monitor task 3.2: we need to localize the position of the cookie bot on that champer (localization in this problem means to get (x,y) of the robot with respect to the room).

task 4: task 4.1: Implement a Python program that simulates an air battlefield using OOP Methods. task 4.2: Create a Linear Regression Model, and train this model on the given dataset.
